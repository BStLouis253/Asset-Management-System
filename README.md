# Asset Management System

Software to manage and track software and hardware inventory and related attributes. CMIS201 Major Project Assignment.

## Software Description

**Who are the users of the software?**

The primary users of the AssetManagementSystem would be corperate stakeholders such as:

- IT Administrators – Responsible for managing and tracking hardware (e.g., laptops, desktops, printers) and software assets (e.g., licenses, versions, subscriptions).

- Finance and Procurement Teams – Who monitor asset purchase history and project replacement cycles.

- Facilities and Operations Managers – Tracking equipment inventory, asset location and assignments.

**What is the purpose of the software?**

The software is designed to streamline asset management by:

- Maintaining a centralized database of all company assets.

- Tracking key hardware and software attributes.

- Allowing addition and removal of assets.

- Enabling sorting and searching of assets based on different attributes.

- Providing import/export functionality for data storage and sharing.

**Where and when will the software be used?**

- This software will be used in corporate offices, warehouses and other asset storage locations.

- The software will be used during purchasing, onboarding/offboarding, audits, budget planning and other activities where assets are transacted.

**How does the software work?**

The software provides a graphical interface where users can:

- Add assets by entering relevant details about the asset.
  
- Sort and search assets based on available attributes.
  
- Load and save assets to disk/file.
  
- Remove retired assets
  

**Why would anyone want to use the software over existing processes?**

- Spreadsheets are inefficient – Manually updating Excel files can lead to errors, version conflicts, and data loss.
  
- Paper-based tracking is outdated – Physical records are hard to search, prone to loss, and require manual calculations.

- Asset mismanagement leads to financial loss – Companies lose track of devices and software licenses, leading to wasted purchases.

- No automated sorting/reporting – Finding all assets from a specific manufacturer is difficult in traditional methods.
